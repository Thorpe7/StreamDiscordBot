# StreamDiscordBot
# This bot is pretty straight forward. 
# From twitch you can add your client id, user login, client secret. 
# With those parameters, the access token should be generated and stored as intended.

# Discord token can be create by the user. 

# Discord message displayed can be changed at user discretion.

# Procflie modified for deployment of app on Heroku. This will have to be configured according to each user, but can be directly pulled from github once set-up.
